## Lesson folders

Each lesson has its own folder that often contain a `LINK.md` and `EXERCISE.md`. New lessons will be released regularly.

### Exercise

Exercises should generally `NOT` be handed in, except the first lesson and the group project. You are recommended to complete all exercises, since they are preparing you for the final assignment and future lessons.

### Link

The `LINKS_X.md` file contains what you need to solve the exercises and you can also find extra material to learn more. If you get stuck on an exercise, remember to check links for that lesson.

### Improvements

If you have any improvements, guides or just better wording, feel free to create a `pull request` with the improvement to this repository.
